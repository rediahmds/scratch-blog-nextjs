# About this repo

The goal is to recreate the website in [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

The final result must be identical or even better than this [Next.js Sample Website](https://next-learn-starter.vercel.app/).

## Learning Notes

- `getStaticProps` is used to fetch external data. Then, Next.js will read that data and do its work. The return value of this function usually passed into a component.
- `getStaticPaths` to generate static paths. Each of that paths will be rendered as individual page.
